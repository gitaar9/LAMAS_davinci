In this project, we will analyse the game **Da Vinci Code**. Da Vinci Code is a game in which players each get a secret code and have to guess the code of the other players. However, by guessing something of another player, you can also give information about your own code. Therefore, the players have to think carefully not only about what they know about the other players' codes, but also about what they know about what the other players know about their codes, and about what the other players know about what they know about the other players' codes, and that is where epistemic logic comes in.

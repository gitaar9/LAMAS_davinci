      <h1 class="w3-text-teal" id = "Introduction">Introduction</h1>
      <p>In this project, we will analyse the game ‘Da Vinci Code’. Da Vinci Code is a game in which players each get a secret code and have to guess the code of the other players. However, by guessing something of another player, you can also give information about your own code. Therefore, the players have to think carefully not only about what they know about the other players’ codes, but also about what they know about what the other players know about their codes, and about what the other players know about what they know about the other players’ codes, and that is where epistemic logic comes in.</p>
      <h2 class="unnumbered" id="game-explanation">Game explanation</h2>
<p>The game consists of twelve black and twelve white blocks each with a number from 0 to 11 on it (each number occurring once on a black and once on a white block), and one black and one white block with a ‘-’ on it. From the back side, the thirteen white and thirteen black blocks are indistinguishable, it is only visible whether they are black or white.<br />
At the start of the game, each player takes a certain number of blocks (usually four or five, depending on the number of players), and places them on the table such that the player himself can see the numbers but the other players cannot. These blocks form this player’s code. The blocks have to be put in ascending order according to the numbers on them, where the ‘-’ can be placed at any place, and in case of equal numbers the black blocks come before the white blocks. Then in each turn the player whose turn it is takes one block from stack, looks what it is and then can guess one block of one other player’s code, e.g. “Is this white block a 1?". The other player must answer truthfully. If the guess was incorrect, the other player says “no” (he doesn’t have to tell what was the actual number on the block), and the player on turn has to reveal the block that he has just taken from the stack and put it at the correct place open in his code. His turn is then over and the next player may take a block from stack and guess a block from another player. If the guess was correct, the other player has to reveal the concerning block and lay it open at the correct place in his code (i.e. the place where it was already standing). The player on turn may - if he wants - guess another block of a player (which can be the same player or another), the same procedure repeats until a wrong guess is made, which ends the turn. He can also choose to not make another guess and add the block he drew to his code in the correct place.<br />
When the total code of a player is revealed, he is out and cannot guess the codes of the other players anymore. The game ends when the codes of all but one players are revealed, the remaining player is the winner.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="example-with-higher-order-knowledge">Example with higher order knowledge</h2>
<p>We will give an example to show where higher order knowledge might be needed in the game. Suppose that in a certain state of the game player <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> has the code [5,6,8,11], and player <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> has the code [4,9,10,-], all in black blocks (to make in an easy example). From player <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, the 5 and the 8 are revealed and from player <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, the 4, the 10 and the ‘-’ are revealed, so the visible codes are [5,?,8,?] for player <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and [4,?,10,-] for player <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. It is <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>’s turn. Player <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> can guess the hidden block of player <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> between the 5 and the 8, he has 50 % chance of guessing correct because it can be either a 6 or a 7. However, if player <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> does guess this block and guesses it wrong, all players know that he didn’t know whether it was a 6 or 7, so they all know that player <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> does not have the 6 or the 7 himself (for if he would have one of them, he would know the number on the block of player <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>). Then they can deduce that the hidden block of player <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> himself must be a 9, because except for 6 and 7 the only numbers between 4 and 10 are 5 and 8, which already lay open in player <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>’s code. Hence, if player <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> guesses that the hidden block of player <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is a 7, he has by doing so given away his own code and can in the next turn of any player be out.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal" id="Models">Models</h1>
      <p>Let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> be the set of players, with <span class="math inline">\(|A|=m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> the number of blocks each player has at the beginning of the game. We will use the system <span class="math inline">\(S_{5(m)}\)</span> to form a Kripke model of a simplified version of the game. In this simplified version, there are only 12 blocks, namely the blocks 1-6 of both colors, there are 3 players, so <span class="math inline">\(m=3\)</span> and each player has 4 blocks so <span class="math inline">\(N=4\)</span>. We also assume that players do not ask for numbers that are in their own code or of which they for some other reason know that cannot be correct (i.e. they will only make guesses that <em>can</em> be true). A Kripke model <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is defined as <span class="math inline">\(M=(S,\pi, R_1, ..., R_m)\)</span> with</p>
<ol>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> a non-empty set of states,</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\pi : S\rightarrow (P\rightarrow \{t,f\})\)</span> a truth assignment for each propositional atom in each state,</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(R_i \subseteq S\times S\)</span> <span class="math inline">\((i=1, ..., m)\)</span> a set of accessibility relations.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Let us denote the white blocks as <span class="math inline">\(W=\{w1, ..., w6\}\)</span> and the black blocks as <span class="math inline">\(B=\{b1, ..., b6\}\)</span>.<br />
</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="initial-model">Initial model</h2>
<p>We can formalise the game as a Kripke model <span class="math inline">\(M=(S,\pi, R_a, R_b, R_c)\)</span>. We will start by creating a model of the beginning of the game. The states are defined as <span class="math inline">\(S = (\langle a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 \rangle, \langle b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4 \rangle, \langle c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4 \rangle) | a_1, ..., c_4 \in B\cup W, a_1 \not = ... \not = c_4, a_1 \prec ...\prec a_4, b_1\prec...\prec b_4, c_1\prec...\prec c_4\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(x_1, ..., x_4\)</span> represent the four blocks of player <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p\prec q\)</span> is defined as ‘the number on <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is lower than the number on <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> or (the numbers on <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> are equal and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is black and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is white)’.<br />
If the players had no information at all about who had which blocks, there would be an accessibility relation between each pair of states: <span class="math display">\[R_x = \{(s,t)\in S\times S\}\]</span> However, the players do have some information and hence we can add some restrictions on the accessibility relations. Since each player knows his own blocks but not those of the other players, the accessibility relations <span class="math inline">\(R_x\)</span> of player <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> are restricted to pairs of states for which their own blocks are the same: <span class="math display">\[R_x = \{(s,t)\in S\times S | \langle x_{1s}, ... x_{4s} \rangle = \langle x_{1t}, ..., x_{4t}\rangle \}\]</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(x_{is}\)</span> represents the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th block of player <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in state <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>.<br />
Furthermore, each player can see the colour of the blocks of the other player, so in all accessible states the colour of all blocks are the same as in the current state: <span class="math display">\[R_x = \{(s,t)\in S\times S | \langle x_{1s}, ... x_{4s} \rangle = \langle x_{1t}, ..., x_{4t}\rangle \}, y_{is} \in W \Leftrightarrow y_{it} \in W \textrm{ for all } y\in A\]</span></p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="taking-turns">Taking turns</h2>
<p>When it is player <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>’s turn, he will guess a block of another player. There are two possibilities, either he can guess right or guess wrong. When he guesses right, the block is revealed to everyone, so the value of that block becomes common knowledge. In the accessibility relations <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> of all agents, the relations to states with a different value for that block will be removed. If he guesses wrong, everyone knows that that block does not have that value, so the relations to states with that value will be removed from every player’s accessibility relations.<br />
Because we assumed that players only make guesses that can be true, the guess can also give the other players some information about the player in turn. All states in which the current player has a block with the number and colour of his guess will be removed from the accessibility relations of the other player, and possibly other deductions can be made.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="example-1">Example 1</h2>
<p>In this section we will illustrate the model defined above by an example. Assume that player <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> has the blocks [<span class="math inline">\(b1, b4, b5, w6\)</span>], player <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> has [<span class="math inline">\(b2, w2, w4, b6\)</span>], and player <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> has [<span class="math inline">\(w1, b3, w3, w5\)</span>]. Because the number of possible states is quite large, we only look from the point of view of player <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. Player <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> only sees his own blocks and the colour of the blocks of the other players. He can deduce right from the start that the white 1 should be the first block of player <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> (because if it would be at a different position, there would be another block in front of it, which could only be the black 1 due to the ordering of the numbers, but he has the black 1 himself). In the same way, he can deduce that the black 6 is the last block of player <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, because the only number that can follow the black 6 is the white 6, which he has himself. Therefore, considering the ordering of the blocks, there are only six possible states from the point of view of player <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. The model with the possible states and accessibility relations for player <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is shown in Figure <a href="#fig:model1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:model1">[fig:model1]</a>. The real state is the state at the top. Reflexive arrows have been left out of the picture, but are there for every state.</p>
<p>Now suppose that player <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> starts and asks whether the third block of player <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is a 3. Player <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> has to answer truthfully that this is indeed the case. Now, all models without a 3 on this place can be removed. The resulting model is shown in Figure <a href="#fig:model2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:model2">[fig:model2]</a>.</p>
<p>Not all actions of other players give information to all other players. Suppose that now it is player <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>’s turn, and he asks whether the first block of player <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is a 2. Player <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> will answer affirmatively, but for player <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, this is of no interest because he already knew that this block was a 2. After this turn, for player <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> the model is still as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:model2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:model2">[fig:model2]</a>.<br />
Now when it is player <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>’s turn, he only has to discriminate between the two states shown in Figure <a href="#fig:model2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:model2">[fig:model2]</a>, so by for example asking whether the last block of player <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is a 5, he will be able to deduce which of the two states is the real state.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="example-2">Example 2</h2>
<p>In order to show a model with accessibility relations for all agents, we take an even more simplified example. Suppose that only the numbers 1, 2, and 3 are in the game for both colours, so every player has only 2 blocks. Suppose that player <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> has two black blocks, player <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> has one white and one black block, and player <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> has two white blocks. This is common knowledge, because everyone can see the colour of the blocks of every player, and knows that the others can see this as well, and knows that the others know that everyone knows, et cetera. Now the Kripke model representing the start of the game is as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:model3" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:model3">[fig:model3]</a>. The accessibility relations for player <span class="math inline">\(a,b,\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> are shown in red, magenta, and cyan respectively. As can be seen in the model, player <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> only has reflexive accessibility relations, because there are no two states in which the blocks of player <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are the same. This shows that player <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> immediately knows everything. On the other hand, for players <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, there are some states that are indistinguishable from each other.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="example-3">Example 3</h2>
<p>(Example from introduction) In this third example, we will show the way higher order knowledge can play a role in the game. Suppose that only all black blocks are in the game, and they are divided such that player <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> has [5,6,8,11], player <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> has [4,9,10,-], and player <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> has [0,1,2,3]. The 7 is not yet in the game. The 5, 8, 4, 10 and - are revealed already. We look from the perspective of player <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. For him, there are six possible states. In Figure <a href="#fig:model4" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:model4">[fig:model4]</a> the Kripke model is shown. The accessibility relations for agent <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> have not been drawn, but are there between every pair of worlds. Also, the reflexive relations are left out, but are there for every world for every agent. The bold numbers denote the numbers that are revealed and therefore are common knowledge among all agents. Now suppose it is the turn of agent <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. He cannot discriminate between the real state (the top left state), and the top right state where agent <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> has a 7 instead of a 6. Therefore, he asks player <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> whether his second block is a 7, to which player <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> must give a negative answer. To player <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, this gives different types of information. Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(a_7\)</span> is the proposition referring to the fact that the second block of player <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is a 7. Of course, now player <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> knows that <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> does not have the 7: <span class="math inline">\(K_c \neg a_7\)</span>. But also he knows that player <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> did not know: <span class="math inline">\(K_c \neg K_b \neg a_7\)</span>. He can therefore cancel out the worlds in which this is not true from his possible worlds. <span class="math inline">\((M,w_3)\models a_7\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((M,w_4)\models a_7\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\((M,w_5)\models a_7\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\((M,w_1)\models K_b \neg a_7\)</span> (in all worlds <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\((w_1,s)\in R_b, (M,s)\models \neg a_7\)</span>: these worlds are exactly <span class="math inline">\(w_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w_2\)</span>), and in the same way <span class="math inline">\((M,w_2)\models K_b \neg a_7\)</span>. Hence, the only remaining world for <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(w_0\)</span>.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="action-model">Action model</h2>
<p>We can also describe the situation as an action model. The only ‘real’ action that can be taken in the game is the action of asking a block from another player, but we discriminate between a right guess and a wrong guess. Because every action that is taken and every answer are public, the relations in the action model are equal for all agents. The precondition for the action ‘right guess’ (<code>rg</code>) is that the guessed number is indeed there, while the precondition for the action ‘wrong guess’ (<code>wg</code>) is that the guessed number is not on that block and that the person who asks does not know this. Let us denote the proposition that block <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> (i.e. the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th block of player <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>) has number <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> as ‘<span class="math inline">\(xi_p\)</span>’.We can therefore define an action model for the game as a structure <span class="math inline">\(\langle E, \sim, \textrm{pre}\rangle\)</span> with</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(E = \{ \texttt{rg}(xi_p), \texttt{wg}(xi_p)|x\in A, i\in N, p\in W\cup B\}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\sim = \{(e,e)|e\in E\}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>pre(<code>rg</code>(<span class="math inline">\(xi_p\)</span>)) = <span class="math inline">\(xi_p\)</span>,<br />
pre(<code>wg(xi_p)</code>)=<span class="math inline">\(\neg xi_p \wedge \neg K_a \neg xi_p\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> the agent that performs the action</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When we combine the model from Example 3 with the action of guessing that the second block of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is a 7, we get the action model shown in Figure <a href="#fig:actionmodel1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:actionmodel1">[fig:actionmodel1]</a>.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal" id="Simulation">Simulation</h1>
      <p>To supplement our research and visualise the theory of mind of different agents, we could build a simulation of a simple scenario where agents play against each other and model their knowledge states. This simulation features a GUI in which the current game state can be viewed (which blocks belong to which player). This GUI features two distinct modes, mode 1 is where we can view a game played by logical agents and see all of their blocks. In mode 2 you can try your luck against the agents yourself and therefore only view your own and blocks visible for all players.</p>
<p>In both modes it is possible to view the worlds a agent considers possible after every turn. We aim to represent the agents view of the world similar to Figure <a href="#fig:model4" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:model4">[fig:model4]</a>. This view only shows the worlds the agent considers possible, but also shows relations for other agents. Therefore it will give insight in the logic used by said agent to make its in-game decisions.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="when-a-player-takes-an-action">When a player takes an action</h2>
<p><em>Hoeft misschien niet in het verslag, maar kan helpen om de simulatie te maken.</em><br />
When it is a player’s turn and he takes a block from the stack, the information on that block is added to his knowledge, i.e. it is as if this block is already in his code. At the end of his turn, all the worlds are updated such that he has added this block to his code.<br />
<br />
When some player takes the action <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{rg}(xi_p)\)</span>, i.e. guessing correctly that the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th block of player <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is number <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, then that block is revealed, so all the worlds where that block has a different value are removed (for all players, because the action is public). The same happens when a player has made a wrong guess and has to reveal the block that he took at the beginning of his turn at the correct place in his code.<br />
<em>Eerst alle models updaten/toevoegen zodat deze speler daar een extra block heeft en dan degenen die niet kunnen weer weghalen, of alleen de models toevoegen waar hij dit specifieke blokje heeft? (en degenen die daardoor niet meer kunnen weghalen)</em><br />
When player <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> takes the action <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{wg}(xi_p)\)</span>, i.e. guessing incorrectly that the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th block of player <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is number <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, everyone knows that that block does not have number <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> so all the worlds where the value of the block <em>is</em> <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> are removed. Furthermore, all players know that player <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> did not know that that block was not <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, so for every player, all relations to worlds in which that player knows that <span class="math inline">\(K_a xi_p\)</span> are removed. This may be different per player, e.g. player <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> might know that player <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> knows something in a certain world, while player <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> does not know that player <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> knows this.<br />
<em>Je had toch de general models uitgerekend door de individuele models uit te rekenen en die dan samen te voegen? Dat zou hier dan weer mooi uitkomen: in het individuele model van elke speler weet je wat die speler weet over wat anderen weten (zoals in Figure 4 bijvoorbeeld: de relaties die daar voor a en b zijn, zijn wat c weet over wat a en b weten omdat het uit het perspectief van c gemaakt is).</em><br />
For every player, the relations to worlds where player <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, according to their knowledge, did not know that <span class="math inline">\(xi_p\)</span> are removed (the worlds themselves are not removed because they might still be accessible for other players). Hence the relations to worlds <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> where for all <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\((s,t)\in R_a, (M,t)\models \neg xi_p\)</span> are removed.<br />
<em>(In een wereld waar alle relaties van a naar werelden gaan waar <span class="math inline">\(xi_p\)</span> niet waar is, weet a dat <span class="math inline">\(xi_p\)</span> niet waar is, en zou hij dus nooit <span class="math inline">\(xi_p\)</span> raden.)</em><br />
